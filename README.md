# dynamic-table
JQuery Plugin for dynamic table - designing based on bootstrap4
# General Overview -
I am great admirer of datatable. I used it for long time and feel something can be improved in it - specifically, when it comes to work with dynamic contents recieving from server, search on specific columns, changing the representation of data (column) in table.

This plugin has been developed to synchronize data with server, search on specific columns and rendering as easy as possilbe. To work with this you just need to know how to write JSON object in javascript and initialize the jQuery plugin.
